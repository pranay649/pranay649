Hello! I'm Pranay, a passionate individual interested in machine learning and deep learning and an aspiring Software Developer. 
I enjoy exploring and working on various projects related to artificial intelligence and its applications. 
Currently, I am focused on enhancing my knowledge in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

**Skills** : 
Machine Learning,
Deep Learning,
C,
Java,
c++

**Projects** : 
**Liver Disease Prediction webpage using Machine learning**: It is a webpage the is designed to predict wheather an individual as Liver Disease or not based on the
Liver test report. The model trained using SVM,Logistic Regression & random Forest Classifier based on our comparitive Analysis of model we selected Random Forest classifier
as training model.

**Learning Goals** : 
Deepening my understanding of CNN architectures and their applications in computer vision tasks.
Exploring different types of RNNs, such as LSTM and GRU, to better understand their sequential data processing capabilities.
Exploring about Software Development tools and Software Engineering.

**Contact Information** :
